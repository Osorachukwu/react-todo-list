Styled component is a popular package used for react styling... styled-components.com ðŸ‘ˆfor instalation and usage  

Default prop is the prop that get used by your component when you dont provid any prop..

???Just like class is a reserved keyword in react and therefore reolaced by classname for attribute for form elements is replaced with htmlFor='' ???

??arial-label='Add Item' is used on  buttons when icons are used on the buttons instead of text, I think its for the screen readers??

??role??

???includes???

???still consult chat gpt on that filter part

useEffect runs on each render / re-render but with the dependency array it on runs once on initial-render(load-time). If there is an item inside the dependency array, useEffect now looks at that and runs each time the is a change on that dependency-item. Use effect is asynchronious in nature so it runs after everything else has rendered.
